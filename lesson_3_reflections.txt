1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository would be useful in order to maintain a backup of 
work that is in your local computer, as well as so that other people can view
or collaborate to the work in your repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If your project is public or simply shared with others, 
other people might be contributing to it on GitHub, so you might want to 
first review any changes before pulling them into your local drive.
