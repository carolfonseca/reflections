1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need it?
When you initialise a repository, git creates a hidden
directory called .git, where all the commits (aka file 
tracking) will be stored. Git does not commit the current
version of files when you create a repository. You need
the repository so that you can use git on a directory to
track the changes (or versions) of particular files. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? WHat value do you think it 
offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory and
repository because it is not a particular directory that
exists - it is a place to prepare files before making commits.
By having this place "in between" the repository and the
working directory, you have a bit more freedom around how you 
want to make changes to the repository.
